# 🚀 Visual UI Similarity Checker (Pro)

A high-performance visual regression tool designed to automate the assessment of React frontend assignments. It compares a **Solution** implementation against a **Student** submission using pixel-perfect image analysis and returns a similarity percentage.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏎️ Ultra-Fast Startup (Proprietary Speed-Hack)
- **Shared `node_modules`**: Uses a `master_project` template with symlinks (Directory Junctions) to avoid running `npm install` for every single upload.
- **Lazy Dependency Learning**: Automatically identifies missing libraries in student projects, installs them into the master folder, and remembers them for future runs.
- **Parallel Bootup**: Launches both solution and student servers simultaneously using `Promise.all`.

### 🛡️ Robust Compatibility
- **Vite & CRA Support**: Automatically detects the build tool and uses the appropriate start scripts.
- **Legacy OpenSSL Support**: Injects `--openssl-legacy-provider` to support older Create React App (CRA v4) projects on modern Node.js versions.
- **Homepage Aware**: Correctly handles projects with custom `homepage` subpaths in `package.json`.
- **Pre-flight Bypass**: Sets `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true` and `CI=true` to prevent interactive prompts or environment mismatches.

### 🌐 Integrated Mock Backend
- **Auto-JSON-Server**: If a `db.json` is detected, the tool automatically launches a mockup backend on port 8000.
- **Custom Logic Support**: If the project contains a custom `server.js`, the tool runs it automatically to support authentication and specialized API logic.

### 📸 Precision Analysis
- **Full-Page Screenshots**: Uses **Playwright (Chromium)** to capture the entire vertical length of the page, not just the viewport.
- **Pixel-by-Pixel Comparison**: Leverages `pixelmatch` to generate transparency-aware similarity scores.
- **Network Idle Detection**: Ensures screenshots are only taken after all assets and API data have finished loading.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Framer Motion (for smooth UI transitions).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Playwright, Pixelmatch, JSZip, fs-extra.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher recommended.
- **Permissions**: Administrative/Elevated privileges may be required on Windows to create directory junctions (symlinks).

### 2. Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd VR_PROJECT

# Setup Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Setup Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 3. Execution
1. **Start Backend**: `cd backend && npm start` (Runs on port 3000)
2. **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (Runs on port 5173)

## 📖 Usage Guide

1. **Upload Solution**: Provide the reference React project ZIP.
2. **Upload Student**: Provide the student's submission ZIP.
3. **Wait for Boot**: The tool will:
   - Extract files.
   - Link dependencies.
   - Start development servers (and mock APIs).
4. **View Results**: Get a side-by-side comparison, a similarity score (0-100%), and a performance breakdown.

## ⚠️ Known Behaviors
- **Initial Learning**: The *very first* time a project with new libraries is uploaded, it may take 1-2 minutes to "learn" the new packages. Subsequent uploads of similar projects will be **instant**.
- **Port Conflict**: The tool dynamically assigns ports to dev servers, but assumes port `8000` is available for `json-server`.
